# Thank you for reviewing my stab at Wellfound's microblog assessment!

## Goal
I updated the home page of this Flask app to display all of the rows in the blog posts table instead of just the static single row.

Hi, I greatly appreciate your time! Attaching a picture of the updated home page below:

A screenshot of the updated home page:

## Contributions
Feel free to clone this repo locally and use your own editor of choice.

If you would rather use the Gitpod development environment for this app:

- Change the dropdown that says "Web IDE" to "Gitpod" (if it already says "Gitpod" skip this step)
- Click the button that says "Gitpod"
